# BigMac-AR
Small project with multi-target image and target image for playing animation, music with Vuforia
Introducing my new AR project, a 3D animation of a burger that disassembles when the box of McDac is detected.
When a specific picture of a violin is detected, a sound is can be played or stopped via pressing virtual button.
This project combines 3D animation and AR technology to bring the burger to life, adding an interactive and immersive element to the user experience.
